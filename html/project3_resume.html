<div id="resume_intro">
<p>I'm Peter Parker, an undergraduate at George Mason University studying Computer Game Design. I've lived and attended school in Virginia my entire life, and am continuing that with my college education. I have an interest in esports management, branding, and graphic design, in addition to critically analyzing game design and the game development process.
</p>

<p>I'm currently working as the President of GMU Esports, honing my proficiency in management and graphic design and using those skills in both a marketing and game development setting. Additionally, I have cultivated team-based organizational and planning skills that are necessary to lead and teach a team, and have applied these skills in and out of academia. Esports management and marketing and video game UX/UI design are my current career and academic focuses.
